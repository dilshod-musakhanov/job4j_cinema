# Cinema Project

General description

In this assignment, we will need to develop a website for buying cinema tickets (one theater, not a chain, for simplicity
to work with less resources/logic).

Our task is to write functionality:
- Registration/Login;
- View of screenings and films;
- Option for buying tickets.

For implementation, we need to use: Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Liquibase, Sql2o, PostgreSQL.
Navigation bar:
Logo. Clicking on it will take you to the main page.
Whatâ€™s On. Display sessions and related movies;
Movies. Display a list of films that are shown in the cinema;
Register Login. If the user is not logged in;
Username/Logout. If the user is logged in.

Level of rights:
All users have the right to view information on the site;
Only registered users can buy tickets. 
If the user is not registered and clicks on the "Buy ticket" button, then he is redirected to the login page.

Implementing admin functionality is not included in this project

I will add more details to READ.ME file closer to final version of the project
